It's raining too heavy for a Saturday. I wished I had left the house with my umbrella, but who can predict the future this days. I took the liberty of dropping
by at my friend's home to extend the season's greetings to her and her family. While finding my way back home, a huge UFO descended from the sky and a troop of aliens walked out of the ship. 
I was shocked to my marrows.
